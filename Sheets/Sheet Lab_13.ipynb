13 Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning\n","\n","Welcome to the 13th session of this series on Practical Machine Learning, where we will continue our discussion on Deep Learning. So we've covered a lot on Computer Vision till now, not only from the perspective of Deep Learning, but also in the entire series. In this session, we will be focussing on *Natural Language Processing* (or simply called *NLP* for short), specifically from the perspective of Deep Learning. \n","\n","Before we proceed with NLP, let us discuss what NLP even is, and what it implies in today's world. \n","\n","Till now, we have understood some basics about Natural Language Processing (in Session 4, on Bayesian Learning). But, what does it mean in the first place?\n","\n","Natural Language Processing is broad field in Artificial Intelligence, that deals with understanding language. This includes building models that understand speech, audio, text, etc. For example, Google Translate, an AI Model, somehow knows how to convert a peice of text/speech into another language. You say \"Hi Siri\" or \"Hey Google\" or \"Alexa\", and your home/phone assistant responds to you in an intelligent way. And this is where today's state of NLP lies. But there's so much that is yet to be developed and discovered. Let us talk about the aspirations of this feild. \n","\n","NLP is not only about identifying language, but also understanding it. Currently NLP has not quite reached there. For example, we still don't know how to build models that actually *understand* the semantics of a language. Like, just apart from identifying English, we don't know how to build models that understand sarcasm, or emotions, or slightly misspelt/mistyped words. Today's models don't understand context well. Infact, there are models now that can generate entire segments of texts. On a superficial inspection, it *seems* that the model generates sensible text, but on closer inspection, you would find out that most of the text, in most cases doesn't make great sense. That is why, even in 2021, most AI chatbots don't work well. \n","\n","To be fair, it is not a fault in the modeling techniques used in NLP, but more so because of our (humans') own lack of understanding of how to model language on a very broad level. Though, I expect, that in a few years, we will be able to develop much better modeling methods to understand language. With that, there will also be new types of models that will be more suitable for NLP tasks. Present Models and optimizers tasks just do the job, but it is possible that NLP techniques will see some major changes in the coming few years, from the very fundamentals, including optimization techniques. The very basis of communication in human society is language, and unless we figure out how AI effectively processes language, it is hard for it to make its place in soceity. \n","\n","But we shouldn't deny that NLP has made some great progress over the few years, and Deep Learning is the reason behind it. If you remember building a text generator in session 4, you will see, how using Deep Learning, we can significantly improve the model. In this session, we will be learning how to build state of the art language models, that generate text, and are also capable of classifying texts into categories. We will be learning how to build Deep Learnign models that are capable of handling texts (called as *Recurrent Neural Networks* (*RNNs*), and also about some variants that have been known to perform effectively, including *LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory Models)* and *Transformers*. \n","\n","Let us begin this session by installing the necessary libraries. We'll be using the fastai library to handle data pipelining and training, so that we can really focus on building our models. And under the hood, we'll essentially be using the PyTorch library, and when you import the fastai library, you're automatically importing all necessary functionalities from the PyTorch library.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"pINuoLJHPKJW","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1618898266608,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":145204,"user":{"displayName":"Palaash Agrawal","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjL9yCJ04ZqXsjzfXN3ZnhHhBLj_Jq9PH4Gpf6xgg=s64","userId":"13438157889830206288"}},"outputId":"43a6f131-9800-499c-c972-9ac957e56b04"},"source":["!pip install sentencepiece >./temp\n","!pip install --upgrade fastai >./temp\n","from fastai.text.all import *"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["\u001b[31mERROR: torchtext 0.9.1 has requirement torch==1.8.1, but you'll have torch 1.7.1 which is incompatible.\u001b[0m\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"snumdWWwLPwJ"},"source":["## Setting up the Data\n","\n","Before starting to explore Language Models, we need a language(text) dataset, on which we perform our experiments.

It contains 50,000 labeled datapoints, the labels of which are a binary class label depicting the sentiment of the review (whether the review is a 'positive' or a 'negative' review), and an additional 50,000 unlabeled movie reviews. You might have guessed that (atleast) one of the things that we will build will be a text classifier using this data. But that's not all! We will discuss how to use these unlabeled datapoints as well. We will go much beyond a text classifier, and essentially build a model that understands language in general!\n","\n","Fastai gives cloud access to download famous datasets, this being one of them. The cloud link can be found by typing `URLs.IMDB`. We can then download the dataset by using the `untar_data` function, which not only downloads the dataset, but also uncompresses the data. Datasets can be in the form of zip files, tar files, 7z files, gzip files, etc.,  but `untar_data` automatically handles all these internally.

Once we do this, we don't treat our data as strings containing sentences and paragraphs, but as sequences of small chunks (words).

Now we need to feed the data into the model and create our text classifier. \n","\n","The fundamental argument is as follows. We know that transfer learning generally helps improve model performance. In the case of images, we used a pretrained model trained on ImageNet or some other dataset, the reason being that we know that training on a larger dataset helps the model understand basic image features that we would expect from the model over any standard image classification problem, like, features of humans, or trees in general. \n","\n","The NLP equivalent of that would be to use weights from a model that already knows the innards of the English Language, like, for example, basic grammar, sentence construction, the meanings of punctuation marks, contexts and so on. This is called a *Language Model*, ie a model that - understand language in a very general sense. The pretrained weights can be used to fine tune our classifier of text. \n","\n","In the case of images, we pretrain our model on a supervised learning dataset, ie a dataset that itself brings forth a supervised learning problem (classification). Turns out that you don't need explicit labels to create language models that understand language. You can train the model without any explicit labels. Essentially we're training the language model using a *self supervised learning* approach. Self Supervised Learning is a type of learning where the task is to learn the general features of the data, rather than doing a mapping from some input to some output. Let us discuss how this is done. \n","\n","So, one of the most common datasets used for pretraining language models is the [WikiText103](https://blog.einstein.ai/the-wikitext-long-term-dependency-language-modeling-dataset/), which is a dataset containing lots of text from the WikiPedia website, from random articles (over 100 million tokens in total). The idea behind this dataset is, that, no matter what your final task is, if it involves English, your model would need to understand basic grammatical, syntactical and logical rules involved in the language. Now, even though Wikipedia may contain a more formal language than the task you wish to do, but it is safe to assume that there is still a lot to learn about basic rules of English from Wikipedia, and this will help our final model, no matter what. So our task is to get a model that has been pretrained on a dataset like WikiText103. \n","\n","But how is this model even trained in the first place? As we mentioned, we use a supervised learning technique. Obviously the neural net that was used to train this model uses some sort of input/output mapping (because that is how neural nets work, there is no other way). But then, how do we make Neural Nets work without explicitly mentioning an output? Well this is done by making the output the same as the input (or of the same type as the input). In which case, the Neural Net would essentially be doing a mapping from the input to the input itself. This is another broad field in Machine Learning, and is known as Representational Learning. \n","\n","In our specific context, we feed a series of tokens as our input, and the target output is the same text, just offset by one token. So our model would be trying to predict the next sequence of text, whenever a peice of text is given. This is how supervised learning approach works in the context of NLP. \n","\n","This is how this would look like. This type of mapping of a text to a peice of text that is offset by only one token is automatically done by the `LMDataLoader` class. It is essentially a child class of the DataLoader class, the job of which is to break the data into batches and feed it into the model.\n","\n","One more important thing to note is that, usually in the case of Images, the dataloader also shuffled the data, so that the model doesnt learn the sequence of images.

"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ov6AUrfiW3lG"},"source":["## Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Models\n","\n","LSTM is an architecture that was introduced back in 1997 by Jürgen Schmidhuber and Sepp Hochreiter. In this architecture, there are not one, but two, hidden states. In our base RNN, the hidden state is the output of the RNN at the previous time step. That hidden state is then responsible for two things:\n","\n","* Having the right information for the output layer to predict the correct next\n","token\n","* Retaining memory of everything that happened in the sentence\n","Consider, for example, the sentences “Henry has a dog and he likes his dog very much” and “Sophie has a dog and she likes her dog very much.” It’s very clear that the RNN needs to remember the name at the beginning of the sentence to be able to pre‐ dict he/she or his/her.\n","\n","In practice, RNNs are really bad at retaining memory of what happened much earlier in the sentence, which is the motivation to have another hidden state (called cell state) in the LSTM. The cell state will be responsible for keeping long short-term memory, while the hidden state will focus on the next token to predict. Let’s take a closer look at how this is achieved and build an LSTM from scratch.\n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ll89W_Fy0zJN7LNVEqcMvjk7eHmTKk4L)\n","\n","In this picture, our input $x_{t}$ enters on the left with the previous hidden state ($h_{t-1}$) and cell state ($c_{t-1}$). The four orange boxes represent four layers (our neural nets) with the activation being either sigmoid ($\\sigma$) or tanh. tanh is just a sigmoid function rescaled to the range -1 to 1. Its mathematical expression can be written like this:\n","\n","$$\\tanh(x) = \\frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x}+e^{-x}} = 2 \\sigma(2x) - 1$$\n","\n","where $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function. The green circles are elementwise operations. What goes out on the right is the new hidden state ($h_{t}$) and new cell state ($c_{t}$), ready for our next input. The new hidden state is also used as output, which is why the arrow splits to go up.\n","\n","Let's go over the four neural nets (called *gates*) one by one and explain the diagram—but before this, notice how very little the cell state (at the top) is changed. It doesn't even go directly through a neural net! This is exactly why it will carry on a longer-term state.\n","\n","First, the arrows for input and old hidden state are joined together. In the RNN we wrote earlier in this chapter, we were adding them together. In the LSTM, we stack them in one big tensor. This means the dimension of our embeddings (which is the dimension of $x_{t}$) can be different than the dimension of our hidden state. If we call those `n_in` and `n_hid`, the arrow at the bottom is of size `n_in + n_hid`; thus all the neural nets (orange boxes) are linear layers with `n_in + n_hid` inputs and `n_hid` outputs.\n","\n","The first gate (looking from left to right) is called the *forget gate*. Since it’s a linear layer followed by a sigmoid, its output will consist of scalars between 0 and 1. We multiply this result by the cell state to determine which information to keep and which to throw away: values closer to 0 are discarded and values closer to 1 are kept. This gives the LSTM the ability to forget things about its long-term state. For instance, when crossing a period or an `xxbos` token, we would expect to it to (have learned to) reset its cell state.\n","\n","The second gate is called the *input gate*. It works with the third gate (which doesn't really have a name but is sometimes called the *cell gate*) to update the cell state. For instance, we may see a new gender pronoun, in which case we'll need to replace the information about gender that the forget gate removed. Similar to the forget gate, the input gate decides which elements of the cell state to update (values close to 1) or not (values close to 0). The third gate determines what those updated values are, in the range of –1 to 1 (thanks to the tanh function). The result is then added to the cell state.\n","\n","The last gate is the *output gate*. It determines which information from the cell state to use to generate the output.
