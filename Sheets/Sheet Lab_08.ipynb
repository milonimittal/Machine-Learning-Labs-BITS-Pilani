That's because Deep Learning is so flexible and efficient, that it can solve almost any problem in the modern age. Neural Networks have reached a point, where they can process almost any kind of data - videos, images, audio, text, tabular data, etc. And in a lot of applications, Neural Networks have been claimed to perform better than human performance. ([This](https://www.eff.org/ai/metrics) notebook provides a comparison of a lot of models on various benchmark problems along with human performance. You would get a general idea about the current state of Deep Learning).\r\n"," \r\n","That's crazy if you think about it, since Artificial Intelligence literally aspires to be as good as human intelligence. We consider human intelligence to be the most superior, and every form of intelligence, including animal intelligence, and Artificial Intelligence is compared to human intelligence.
