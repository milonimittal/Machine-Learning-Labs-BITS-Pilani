We discussed about Convolutional Neural Networks and how to use it for fundamental computer vision applications such as classification of images, and got some pretty wonderful results as well. You must have built your own image classifier on your own dataset, using very less lines of code. Let us continue our journey in computer vision. We'll be building some advanced computer vision systems. In this session, we'll be learning about two types of Computer Vision applications - *Object localization* and *Segmentation*.\n","\n","Object Localization involves identifying where in an image certain objects lie. There are many ways to do this, but an extremely popular way to do this is by bounding boxes. \n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Ft_d89BCa4SJXzhryQSJKvmSnHkcSj9T)\n","\n","It is extremely useful in tracking the position and movement of objects. For example, bounding boxes are very widely used in surveillance systems to identify accidents, criminals, or just to ensure that everything is going smoothly. \n","\n","Goverments use traffic surveillances systems that use object localization technology to identify which cars pass through a particular location. This not only can be used to automatically fine people who break the traffic rules, but also as an intelligence system that accounts for the whereabouts of a vehicle in case of a criminal activity. It can also be used to identify accidents, without a human operator necessarily searching for such incidents. Thus, a system like this can help reduce burden on the human resources required for efficient monitoring. \n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HKsH_yKs9L5WrbOBePqsP38fmie02ie6)\n","\n","Apart from this, it is a key element in the vision system of self-driving cars, that need to identify objects to avoid collisions. \n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1W_jZmPvmVppB6hXBSCsgFTbvVbjfR_tg)\n","\n","Not only vehicles, even people can be monitored for similar reasons. Many people even install such systems at their homes to detect burglaries. And this is also the technology that is used for facial recognition. While it is a wonderful application, there are also some growing concerns regarding the right to privacy of citizens of a place, when it comes to facial recognition for surveillance systems at places, which may not be completely necessary. \n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1q-dIQvqpdjnIWQgYi3xzHB87dWg-wwn0)\n","\n","Not just humans or vehicles, localization can be used for specific applications, like keeping track of your cattle if you're a farmer, or to separate different types of trash through a robot at a recycling factory, and so on. \n","\n","AI has turned out to be one of the most efficient ways to carry out object localization. A lot of research has been done in this area. A few years ago, it used to be one of the hottest topic in AI research. An algorithm called [YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) (*You Only Look Once*) was one such object localization algorithm, the name of which is still very famous, and even after many years, people are working to improve it, even if marginally. Just last year in 2020, the fifth version of YOLO (YOLOv5) was released, which introduced minor changes such as changing the activation function, or the architecture very slightly. \n","\n","Lately, however, there has been a decline in the number of publications each year on this topic. Yet, it is still one of the most popular systems deployed in the industry, especially in high end systems such as self driving cars, autonomous robots, surveillance systems. \n","\n","Infact, it is such a huge deal, that there are full fledged companies that build software for object localization. Most car manufacturers, that now use computer vision driving aid do not develop their own software, but outsource it. Even Tesla used to outsource its driving assist technologies until a few years ago.\n","\n","Segmentation is another form of object localization, but with a slightly different approach. The idea is not to create a bounding box around objects, but to create a map of pixels which tell us which pixel belongs to which object. This makes it a somewhat more refined version of object localization and detection. This is what segmentation looks like. \n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1VCqNjLnU5JDvH0MSHfAqf9s5GNssAOCw)\n","\n","Each pixel is classified into an object. This produces a segmentation map, which you can overlay ontop of the original image to understand where objects are in the image. \n","\n","Segmentation helps us better understand the overall image, since every pixel is classified into an object. It is widely used in satellite imagery to understand the different types of land areas, or settlements ir even individual peices of farmlands. Some institutions have been doing some research on using segmentation to classify soil as fertile or infertile based on only satellite imagery and thermal sensors. \n","\n","Let us begin by understanding a bounding box prediction system, and then move on to segmentation.\n","\n","Before anything else, we will begin by installing the necessary libraries."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ec3zgg4VfL5C"},"source":["%cd"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"s_cxaedbmvSj"},"source":["!pip install --upgrade fastai >./tmp\n","from fastai.vision.all import *\n","\n","!git clone https://github.com/muellerzr/Practical-Deep-Learning-for-Coders-2.0.git >./tmp\n","%cd 'Practical-Deep-Learning-for-Coders-2.0/Computer Vision'\n","from imports import *\n","%cd\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Q93dg2Pov1Mj"},"source":["## Bounding Box Object Detection\n","\n","Our goal is to train a Convolutional Neural Network that can predict not classes, but cordinates of a bounding box.

The tough part is to predict the bounding boxes.

But here, the model gives an entire image (mask) as the output. How do we design Neural Nets that do that. \n","\n","There is a separate class of Convolutional Neural Networks, called as **U-Nets**. UNets [were first introduced](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) in 2015 for biomedical image segmentation. Initially it was not given much attention by the AI community, but in the past 3 years or so, they have become very famous for segmentation in areas outside of biomedical studies. \n","\n","\n","This is what a UNet looks like\n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1RESdhDSKaa-wSlVb7wT4O045Z4r5qkaP)\n","\n","Its called a Unet because it is generally represented as a U-shaped network!\n","\n","The first half of the network is called an encoder, and the other half (on the right) is called the decoder network.\n","\n","As we discussed before, encoder is anything that derives features.

We feed an image, and get certain features at the end. \n","\n","The second half is nothing but the *reverse* of a CNN. The reverse of a convolution is often called as a deconvolution. \n","\n","Remember how a convolution over an image, results in a map that is slightly lower in dimensions that the image iteself?

This is similar to the ResNet architecture as we've seen. The purpose of these is to retain maximum information, since we likely lose a lot of information at the bottom of the UNet (because we're trying to condense all the information in the input image, to a vector of very less dimension, say only 1024 features). \n","\n","So, because of this deconvolutional network, we get an image as an output. We can apply standard Training procedure on this. The idea is the same as before. We have an input (image), and a target (image, in this case, unlike before). This target image need not be the same as the input image. In our case, the raw input image is the input, and the segmentation masks are the output. We wish that the predictions are as close to the target value as possible. So we define a loss function, that measures how different the prediction and target are. Next we use standard Gradient Descent to optimize the model. \n","\n","This is a third type of Machine Learning prediction, which I refer to as \"Generation\".
