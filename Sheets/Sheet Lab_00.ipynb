This is because of the highly dynamic nature of python, which makes it very efficient to handle data. The language is also very intuitive, so one does not have to learn a lot of unnecessary syntax (such as brackets and semicolons). Another factor that has led to the popularity of Python is the large community. A large community means that platforms and libraries constantly grow, and bugs are solved very fast. A large community also offers support to beginners and professionals alike, which attracts them towards itself. Infact, Python has reached a point, where it is the only self-sufficient language to exist today, wiping all its competition in the past few years (such as R, Caffe, Java, etc). \r\n","\r\n","To give you a deeper insight, a lot of frameworks have been developed on top of Python (meaning, a lot of libraries have been developed using Python, with the aim to make programmers' lives easier, so that they dont have to write the code from scratch). As you will see yourself, you can create a State-of-the-Art AI model that can differentiate between people (such as in a facial recognition system) or an object detection system (such as in a self-driving-car) in as few as 5 lines of Python code. \r\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"A1AF3rEAM1Vy"},"source":["#The Environment: Jupyter Notebooks\r\n","\r\n","The platform on which this tutorial has been developed is called a Jupyter Notebook.

Any text editor will work! \r\n","\r\n","There are a few perks to using Jupyter Notebooks. \r\n","* It is highly interactive. You can see, how we can even write notes and text inside the same document as your code.\r\n","* If you come across a bug in the code, you don't need to rerun the entire code.

Computers could now handle Computation, Information Processing, and information storage. Communication Systems also improved. And the Internet emerged too! Just 20 years ago, there were no cell phones widely available. Today, we have highly evolved platforms to communicate - over Calls, Social Media, the \"traditional\" media, like theTelevision, etc. \r\n","This has not only helped us connect better, but allowed us to work on even more intellectual tasks, such as Research, both Scientific and Social, Large Scale Global Trade, Space Exploration, Global Economy, etc.\r\n","\r\n","What AI and autonimity will allow us to do, is to focus on even more intellectual tasks, by doing the everyday cognitive tasks for us.

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning, and is probably the most famous type of Machine Learning.

The reason it is so famous, is because of the great flexibility that Neural Networks provide. They can solve any complexity of problems easily.
